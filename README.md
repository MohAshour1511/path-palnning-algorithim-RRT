# path palnning algorithim RRT
 Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) is a path planning algorithm widely used in robotics for navigating complex environments. It works by incrementally building a tree rooted at the robot's starting position, with branches extending towards random points in the space. At each step, the algorithm selects a random point and attempts to extend the tree towards it while avoiding obstacles. The process continues until the tree reaches the goal.  RRT is especially useful for high-dimensional or non-linear systems where traditional path-planning methods might struggle. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice for real-time applications like autonomous navigation.
